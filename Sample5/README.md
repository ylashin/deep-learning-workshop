# Object detection using ONNX & YOLO

In this sample, we will see how to consume a ready made model provided in ONNX format.
It could be developed using another deep learning library, but using ONNX it can be consumed easily.
That's a promising initiative for promoting deep learning model interoperability.

## Steps

* Download YOLO model https://www.cntk.ai/OnnxModels/tiny_yolov2/opset_1/tiny_yolov2.tar.gz
* Complete the VS solution by adding a model inference library using the above ONNX model and then complete the prediction part


## Pitfalls
* Flattened response data parsing
* Index swap done by trial and error
* x & y of predicted bounding box are for the center not top left
